foreword

performance info :

cache levels are :
   1. full cache
   2. cached headers
   3. no cache

at this time cache level 2 is not finished
and the webmail runs on level 1

level 1 is very slow when the mailbox is created (everithing gets loaded)
 but very fast after.

so be patient on mailbox first synchro

-> level 2 will be much,much faster at box generation
