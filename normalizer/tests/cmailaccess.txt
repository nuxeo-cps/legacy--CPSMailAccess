CPSMailAccess Extensions
------------------------

CPSMailAccess uses a C extension module called `cmailmaccess` to speed up some
 process.

Some code will slowly move into cmailaccess to optimize mail indexing and
searching.

The first C element is the normalizer, used to clean up words that get indexed,
in order to be able to find mails with special characters.
