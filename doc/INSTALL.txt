INSTALLATION NOTES
==================

Prerequisites
-------------

To install CPSMailAccess you will need:

- a working Zope 2.9.x + CPS 3.4.0 or greater

- rdflib 2.0.6 : http://rdflib.net/

Products Setup
--------------

Extract CPSMailAccess into your Products directory

**Warning:** You must remove the CPSWebMail Product from your
instance.  This is very important, as it might interfere.

Run CPSMailAccess installer with::

  python setup.py install

as root user.

Webmail installation
--------------------

To install CPSMailAccess, go to portal_setup and to the profiles tab.
Choose `CPSMailAccess` profile and import it.


Configuration
=============

Portal setup
------------

After installation, a new action appears in the portal action box:
"configure webmail" that will lead you to a form where you can set
up the webmail parameters that will apply to all users.

For each parameter, if the "portal wide" checkbox is unchecked,
that means each user will have to set it up in his or her mailbox.
The classical configuration is to let the user set up login and
password and signature, so everyone shares the same parameters for
IMAP server, SMTP, etc...

Quick parameters review :

- HOST: name of imap host
- Port: port of imap host
- SSL ? : tells if the webmail uses Secure socket layer (O or 1)
- Connection Type: type of connection, should be left at "IMAP"
- Draft Folder name: should be left at INBOX.Drafts
- Login: imap login, should be left blank
- Maximum depth in folder creation: tells how deep folders can be created
- Maximum length for folder names: tells how long can be folder names when
  they are created
- Displayed columns: Displayed columns and order in mail folder view
- Password: IMAP password, should be left blank
- Sent folder name: should be left at INBOX.Sent
- signature: text that will appear in the footer of mails sent
- SMTP Host: SMTP host name
- SMTP Port: SMTP port name
- Trash folder name: should be left at INBOX.Trash
- Treeview style:

  + if lotus, the trash, sent and draft folders appear outside INBOX
  + if classical, they will be children of INBOX

- SMTP Folder: This is the server system folder where messages
  that are being sent are written. More information below.
- Direct SMTP send ? : if 0, SMTP Folder is used, otherwise,
  mails are sent directly to the SMTP server.
- Access field (field:value): this let the administrator decide
  whether the user can use the webmail or not by retrieving for the
  members directory the given field value and check if its value
  equals the given value.

  Note that you can prefix the value by '!' to test that it
  differs from the value.

  This can be useful in some cases.  Example:
  `accountStatus:!disable`

About SMTP Folder:

- SMTP Folder is MailDir folder used for asynchronous sends of
  mails. In order to work you need to provide a path on your
  system that can be written by the zope process.

- CPSMailAccess will take care of initializing the MailDir the first time,
  so if you can provide a path where the last part is not existing yet.

- For example::

      /tmp/foo/bar

- CPSMailAccess will create the "bar" folder. /tmp/foo path have
  to exists though.

- If bar already exists but is not a MailDir folder structure, it
  won't work.

- A maildir structure is composed of three sub folders: cur, new
  and tmp.


User setup
----------

1. Enable the webmail

   Go to your preferences, and change "webmail activated" to
   "yes". After you have validated this choice, you will see a new
   entry in your actions, called "My mails".

2. Configure your box

   The first time you click on "My mails" will bring you to the
   configuration screen after a little while (this is because it
   tests if your box can be run without any configuration).

   There you will need to provide a few informations:

   To quickly set your box, you need to provide these parameters::

       Login: mail server login name
       Password: mail server password
       Signature: any text

   Submit your changes with the "submit" button.

3. First synchronization

   The first synchronization takes a big while: all mails from
   server are fetched and indexed to create a browsing structure
   into zope.

   For big boxes (>30 0000 mails) it can take up to 5 minutes
   sometimes, depending on the server strength and on the network.
   But this needs to be done just once. If you don't care about
   sub folders of your IMAP box, you can even pass this step.

   Another good idea would be to clean up the box before
   synchronizing it.

   In the Administration panel, click on the "Synchronize the
   whole box" button. This will launch the work. When the box is
   synchronized, you will be taken in your INBOX and will be able
   to start to use the webmail.

4. Every day synchronization

   For now on, every time you will click on "My Mails" the box will
   get synchronized. The webmail will just synchronize INBOX. This
   should not last more than a few seconds. You can do a
   synchronization manually with the "get messages" button.

5. How to use the webmail

   Please refer to the user manual


Extra Notes
===========

1. Using other mail client within the same mail account at the same time

   If you are using at the same time the webmail and another mail
   client, you can have unexpected events. For example, if another
   mail client filters incoming messages, by marking them as
   "deleted" and do not expunge them, they will still appear in
   the webmail and marked as deleted until the mail client is
   closed.

   Trying to work on those "pre-deleted" messages can lead to
   errors.

2. Attached files

   Attached files gets scanned when you are viewing the mail, so
   the attach icon won't appear until the mail is viewed.
