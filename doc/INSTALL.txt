A - INSTALLATION NOTES
======================

1 - Prerequisites
2 - zasyncdispatcher installation
3 - Zope X3 installation (Zope 2.7.x only)
4 - Products setup
5 - Zope 3 <-> Zope 2 path setup (Zope 2.7.x only)
6 - Webmail installation

----------
1- Prerequisites

To install CPSMailAccess you will need:

- a working Zope 2.7.x + CPS 3.3.4 or greater.
  The installation procedure is simpler with Zope 2.8.x
- Zope 2.7.x specifics:
   + ZopeX3-3.0.0 : http://www.zope.org/Products/ZopeX3
   + Five 1.0.1 or greater : http://codespeak.net/z3/five/
- rdflib 2.0.6 : http://rdflib.net/
- zasyncdispatcher (optional) http://svn.nuxeo.org/trac/pub/browser/zasyncdispatcher/

2 - zasyncdispatcher installation

If you want to do background synchronisation (ie for big intranets setup)
 CPSMailAccess is compatible with zasyncdispatcher, a small zope product
  on the top of zasync.

get it on nuxeo svn:

    svn co http://svn.nuxeo.org/pub/zasyncdispatcher/trunk zasyncdispatcher

3 - Zope X3 installation (Zope 2.7.x specific)

Please install ZopeX3-3.0.0 on your system (usually in /opt/ZopeX3-3.0.0) with
the python version you use for Zope2.7 and CPS, e.g.::

  $ ./configure --prefix /opt/ZopeX3-3.0.0 --with-python /usr/bin/python
  $ make
  $ make install
  $ make check

4 - Products setup

Put Five (Zope 2.7 users) and CPSMailAccess

WARNING: You must remove the CPSWebmail Product from your instance,
this is very important, as it might interfer.

5 - Zope 3 <-> Zope 2 path setup (Zope 2.7 specific)

Edit your $INSTANCE/etc/zope.conf to add the following path declaration::

  path /opt/ZopeX3-3.0.0/lib/python

6 - Webmail installation

Then you can restart Zope and add an external method in your CPS portal
instance to install CPSMailAccess::

   Id            : cpsmailaccess_installer
   Title         : whatever
   Module Name   : CPSMailAccess.install
   Function Name : install

And run it.


B - CONFIGURATION
=================

1 - Portal setup

2 - User setup
  a - Enable the webmail
  b - Configure your box
  c - First synchronization
  d - Every day synchronization
  e - How to use the webmail

------------------

1 - Portal setup

After installation, a new action appears in the portal action box: "configure
webmail" that will lead you to a form where you can set up the webmail
parameters that will apply to all users.

For each parameter, if the "portal wide" checkbox is unchecked, that means each
user will have to set it up in his or her mailbox. The classical configuration
is to let the user set up login and password and signature, so everyone shares
the same parameters for IMAP server, SMTP, etc...

quick parameters review :

    o HOST: name of imap host
    o Port: port of imap host
    o SSL ? : tells if the webmail uses Secure socket layer (O or 1)
    o Connection Type: type of connection, should be left at "IMAP"
    o Draft Folder name: should be left at INBOX.Drafts
    o Login: imap login, should be left blank
    o Maximum depth in folder creation: tells how deep folders can be created
    o Maximum length for folder names: tells how long can be folder names when
      they are created
    o Displayed columns: Displayed columns and order in mail folder view
    o Password: IMAP password, should be left blank
    o Sent folder name: should be left at INBOX.Sent
    o signature: text that will appear in the footer of mails sent
    o SMTP Host: SMTP host name
    o SMTP Port: SMTP port name
    o Trash folder name: should be left at INBOX.Trash
    o Treeview style :
      if lotus, the trash, sent and draft folders appear outside INBOX
      if classical, they will be childs of INBOX
    o SMTP Folder: This is the server system folder where messages
                   that are beenig sent are written. More information below
    o Direct SMTP send ? : if 0, SMTP Folder is used, otherwise,
                           mails are sent directly to the SMTP server
    o Access field (field:value): this let the administrator decide wheter
                                  the user can use the webmail or not
                                  by retrieving for the members directory
                                  the given field value and check
                                  if its value equals the given value.
				  Note that you can prefix the value
                                  by '!' to test that it differs from the value.
				  This can be useful in some cases. 
                                  Example:  `accountStatus:!disable`
				    
about SMTP Folder:

    SMTP Folder is MailDir folder used for asynchronous sends of mails.
    In order to work you need to provide a path on your system
    that can be written by the zope process.

    CPSMailAccess will take care of initializing the MailDir the first time,
    so if you can provide a path where the last part is not existing yet.

    For example:

          /tmp/foo/bar

    CPSMailAccess will create the "bar" folder. /tmp/foo path have to exists though.

    if bar already exists but is not a MailDir folder structure, it won't work.

    A maildir structure is composed of three sub folders: cur, new and tmp.


2 - User setup

a - Enable the webmail

Go to your preferences, and change "webmail activated" to "yes". After you have
validated this choice, you will see a new entry in your actions, called "My
mails".

b - Configure your box

The first time you click on "My mails" will bring you to the configuration
screen after a little while (this is because it tests if your box can be run
without any configuration).

There you will need to provide a few informations:

to quickly set your box, you need to provide these parameters :

    Login: mail server login name
    Password: mail server password
    Signature: any text

submit your changes with the "submit" button

c - First synchronization

The first synchronization takes a big while: all mails from server are fetched
and indexed to create a browsing structure into zope.

For big boxes (>30 0000 mails) it can take up to 5 minutes sometimes, depending
on the server strength and on the network. But this needs to be done juste
once. If you don't care about sub folders of your IMAP box, you can even pass
this step.

Another good idea would be to clean up the box before synchronizing it.

In the Administration panel, click on the "Synchronize the whole box" button.
This will launch the work. When the box is synchronized, you will be taken in
your INBOX and will be able to start to use the webmail.

d - Every day synchronization

For now on, everytime you will click on "My Mails" the box will get
synchronized. The webmail will just synchronize INBOX. This should not last
more than a few seconds. You can do a synchronization manually with the "get
messages" button.

e - How to use the webmail

Please refer to the user manual


C - EXTRA NOTES
===============

1 - Using other mail client within the same mail account at the same time

If you are using at the same time the webmail and another mail client, you can
have unexpected events. For example, if another mail client filters incoming
messages, by marking them as "deleted" and do not expunge them, they will still
appear in the webmail and marked as deleted until the mail client is closed.

Trying to work on those "pre-deleted" messages can lead to errors.

2 - Attached files

Attached files gets scanned when you are viewing the mail, so the attach icon
won't appear until the mail is viewed.

3 - Using zasyncdispatcher

CPSMailAccess can be used with zasyncdispatcher: if it founds it,
synchronizations will be sent to background.
